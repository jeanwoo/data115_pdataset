Personal dataset project for DATA 115 (WSU, Fall 2020)

![3PA per season visualization](https://github.com/jeanwoo/data115_pdataset/blob/master/3PA_visual.png?raw=true)

This scatterplot shows the average amount of three-pointers attempted per game, by the season with each point corresponding to a specific year. The scatterplot is organized from the latest year recorded (2019-2020) to the earliest year recorded (1979-1980).

## Motivation

I have always shown an interest in statistics relating to sports, more specifically basketball. Growing up watching the NBA, I was always fascinated with the amount of data is collected; every second in each game has some sort of statsitic recorded and are analyzed even further through advanced statistics.

The question I sought out to answer myself was: How and why are players shooting (and making) increasingly more three pointers every year in the NBA? And how does pace influence the amount of three pointers attempted and made?
