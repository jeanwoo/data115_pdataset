# The Three Pointer: NBA's Most Valuable Shot
Personal dataset project for DATA 115 (WSU, Fall 2020)

## Motivation

I have always shown an interest in statistics relating to sports, more specifically basketball. Growing up watching the the professional basketball league NBA, I was always fascinated with the amount of data is collected; every second in each game has some sort of statsitic recorded and are analyzed even further through advanced statistics.

The question I sought out to answer myself was: How and why are players shooting (and making) increasingly more three pointers every year in the NBA? And how does pace influence the amount of three pointers attempted and made?

## Data Process

This data which was grabbed from the basketball-reference, contains the average general stats for all NBA teams combined every year, such as the average points allowed per game, average points scored, average height, etc. The data stretches all the way back to the year 1946 to present day (the earlier years have limited data in comparison to more recent times, but still useful data). This is useful to see how and when professional basketball has changed over the years. For example, you can see that three-point attempts and makes have skyrocketed in the past 5 years due to more teams settling for more efficient shots rather than mid-range shots. Basketball-reference has an easy tool in which it translates the data into a copyable .csv format. 

## Visualization

This scatterplot shows the average amount of three-pointers attempted per game, by the season with each point corresponding to a specific year. The scatterplot is organized from the latest year recorded (2019-2020) to the earliest year recorded (1979-1980).

## Analysis

Setting a threshold on the number of 3-point attempts per game, showed me which specific years had the highest frequency on shooting from deep. I learned that the recent surge of shooting the 3 pointer hasnâ€™t always been steadily increasing; there were a certain number of years (1994-1997) that had a sudden increase in attempts and also had even more attempts than a good amount of following years.
